## Breakdown of the five principal necessities

Here we will make a detailed analysis of the context, challenges, solutions and tempting non-solutions for each of the principal necessities.

## 1. Trusted supply chain

With supply chain in this document, the following resources for the creation of information systems are included

* Hardware
* Software
* Services, notably among these;
  * Trust services such as Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    * Notably; Entra ID, Okta, AWS IAM, GCP IAM
  * Code and package repositories
    * Notably; Github, Docker/AWS/GCP/Azure container registries, NPM and other programming language specific repositories
  * Build systems
    * Notably; Github actions

These supply chains are heavily relying on one of two kinds of actors that both present challenges for a non-US headquartered organization or non-US state:

* Supply chains relying on national or multi-national technology companies, often US headquartered.
* Supply chains relying on, often unpaid, individual open source contributors that may be both unidentified and vulnerable to pressure form nation state actors.

### Solutions to the trusted supply chain challenge

* Create multi-national organizations among cooperating nations that create and maintain components and services for the shared ecosystem in the categories mentioned here.
* Alternatively create an ecosystem of multiple redundant national components and services that are interchangeable, but note that this will be extremely costly.

**Non-solutions:** Hope that the inherent leverage over national organizations and individual contributors will not be used against us during conflict.

**WARNING: The article is not finished. From here onwards it is only a skeleton.**

## 2. Trusted hosting

With hosting in this document, the following resources for the creation of information systems are included

* Platforms
  * Notably; AWS, Azure, GCP (all US headquartered)
* Infrastructure
* Housing

## 3. Trusted operations

With operations in this document, the following resources for the creation of information systems are included

* Personnel
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* External operations
