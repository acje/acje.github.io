# Digital Sovereignty

*Break digital vassalage. Use politics and architecture to reshape the systems that run our infrastructure and services. By targeting the ecosystem, every sector of society gains.*

## The Risk We Built

Our infrastructure runs on brittle, shared systems. They fail together. The cocktail of pervasiveness, commonality and fragility creates conditions of systemic vulnerabilities, prone to cascading failures. We must set out to chart an ecosystem that drives common vulnerabilities to tolerable levels. Describing how existing information systems can be sufficiently patched and remodeled to become sufficiently secured is not a goal; in fact, it is assumed to be impossible. A real rupture needs to happen, and the old systems will not likely cross the chasm. Still, the defeatism that prevails in parts of the IT industry—that we simply cannot have inherently secure systems—is equally rejected in this article. It will be asserted that such an ecosystem consists of five principal necessities. By targeting the ecosystem, every sector of society gains. This must be done through politically mandated, verifiable and trusted: supply chains, hosting, and operations. Further, this must be combined with architecture principles that limit blast radius by employing isolation as a defense-in-depth strategy and rigidly enforce least-privilege interfaces at all levels.

## Fragile Systems, Everywhere

The geopolitical rules are changing. We do not yet know them. The systems and attitudes that got us here are unlikely to carry us through. For the purpose of this post, I will defer the naming of the coming period to the historians. When considering this looming challenge it is important to realize that the adversaries and their capabilities are not the significant source of the problem. The adversary is inevitable. The big problem is our own creation of a target-rich environment of critically important systems with common vulnerabilities. There will eventually be an adversary with the means and motivation to exploit the vulnerabilities against us. The additional risk posed by a nation-state adversary is not its ability to penetrate and exploit information systems, but its ability to coordinate with other events. The list of historic attacks exploiting systemic weaknesses is long: Stuxnet, NotPetya, WannaCry, HeartBleed, SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline operations, Ukraine energy grid attacks, and Salt Typhoon telecom attacks, to name a few famous examples. These attacks come in uneven waves. Their impact tracks the field of targets more than the skill of the attacker.

### Self-Organized Criticality

Forest fires teach a hard rule: small sparks, big damage. The nature of the spark does not matter. The buildup in the ecosystem does. The spark is inevitable. Mathematician Per Bak and others named it: self‑organized criticality.

Pervasive digital transformation can unfortunately achieve the same. We seed every sector with insecure systems, thereby creating a situation where even a single mode of attack or shared vulnerability may trigger a ripple effect through our society. This could end up tearing down critical infrastructure and services like energy, communication, healthcare, finance, transportation, and water supply. In the worst case scenario these will coordinate in time with other adversarial events.

The fix is simple—not easy. Use politics and architecture to reshape the ecosystem that makes our systems. Three political and two architectural necessities follow. They will not erase risk; they will cut it to levels fit for critical infrastructure and services.

### Critical or Not, Built the Same

Critical systems add rigor and isolation. Yet they use the many of the same components as non‑critical ones. When the functional needs are the same, there is rarely any gain in using lower‑grade software components or services in non‑critical systems. The hardware may vary somewhat more in quantity and sometimes also in quality, but most system attributes are software‑defined these days.

## Where the Fight Is Won

Where we act matters. The digital ecosystem supplies parts and people. From it we build systems. Systems face security events from internal failure, nature, and adversary attacks. Security outcomes depend on system resilience and organizational response. Act at the ecosystem level to lift outcomes across the board.

The *digital ecosystem* consists of all the available services, components, and trained personnel that go into creating *information systems*. The systems themselves are created from what is available at their time of creation and what can reasonably be retrofitted during their period of maintenance, which may span decades. These information systems cause *security events* such as unexpected downtime due to internal, natural, or adversarial actions affecting the system. Depending on the system's ability to withstand these events and the organization's ability to plan for and react to these events, we get *security outcomes*. In this post, we will look at actions we can take at the ecosystem level to create a situation where all new and actively maintained systems can be made to produce meaningfully better security outcomes. When we intervene at this level, we are more likely to maximize impact compared to intervening at lower levels of this model.

Digital ecosystem → Information systems → Security events → Security outcomes

We must change the ecosystem that shapes our systems. Three political and two architectural necessities will carry pervasive digitization with less risk.

## Five Hard Necessities

We group necessities into politics and architecture. The political necessities will often require multinational action. Architecture may also need political help to advance at an acceptable pace, but these mandates must leave room for change. These five necessities make digital systems meaningfully more secure by strengthening our digital sovereignty and ability to defend our information systems.

### Political necessities

Strategic and operational means to sustain our ability to build and maintain

- Trusted supply chain
- Trusted hosting
- Trusted operations

### Architectural necessities

Tactical means to create defendable systems

- Maximally isolated components of least capability
- Least-privilege interfaces

## What Comes Next

In the next parts I will break down the political and architectural necessities in more detail, define scope, identify inherent challenges, and outline solutions and "near-enemy" non-solutions.
