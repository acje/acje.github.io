# Scaling agile - Lessons observed

These are my notes on how an organisation transformed quickly from hardly being able to run a handfull of digitalization projects in parallell and only creating vale from them sporadically, into a fast moving agile organizsation.

TLDR; Obtaining massive improvements in speed, domain knowledge and short term value creation was very doable. Just follow "Accellerate" and implement stream aligned teams and plattform teams form "Team topologies" and make sure your teams gets a "mission" described while protecting them form strong internal forces that will want to place orders for change in their systems. The lessons here are more subtle and twofold; 1) Speed is not a substitute for direction and 2) creating value creates second order chalenges in the shape of risk and opportunities hiding or missing in srtucture of your implementations.
