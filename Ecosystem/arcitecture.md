## 4. Maximally isolated components of least capability

With components in this document, the following resources for the creation of information systems are included

Challenges

### Solutions to the components challenge

* Web assembly component - fast & sandboxed

Non-solutions

* Third party code - technically ok, but impractical to control
* Library - not sandboxed
* Script language (Lua, embedded JS engine) - inefficient
