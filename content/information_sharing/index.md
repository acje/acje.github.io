# Information sharing is not a solved problem

TODO: Write an article about the real-time, inter-org, sustainable information-sharing platform depicted below.

## The question is always the same

The question is always the same: "We just need to share this information with X." The follow-up by the tech lead, architect, developer, or administrator is also always the same: What are the requirements?

And that is a question rarely, if ever, answered fully. Performance, completeness, correctness, [security]({{< relref "CISQ-maturity/index.md" >}}), maintenance, budget? Everyone has their own subset of requirements, which they are usually only partially aware of. What if we could solve for everything except budget, once, and drive down the cost through economies of scale?

That is the strategy underlying the following design.
