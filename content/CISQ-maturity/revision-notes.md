# CISQ revision notes from validation

[Back to improvements](/CISQ-maturity/improvements/)

## Changes introduced after validation

### 1) Authenticity definition tightened

- Before: "known origin"
- After: "origin backed by verifiable provenance evidence"
- Rationale: reduce false-positive authenticity labels.

### 2) Control definition clarified for shared responsibility

- Before: "exclusively controlled by enumerated entities"
- After: "controlled within an explicitly enumerated boundary and authority model"
- Rationale: improves cloud and multi-party applicability.

### 3) Availability assessment made time-bounded

- Before: "timely access"
- After: "timely access measured against declared objective and interval"
- Rationale: improves reproducibility and avoids arbitrary judgments.

## Editorial improvements

- Added symbolic composition notation.
- Added interpretation rules and counterexamples.
- Added evidence tags to support scored assessments.

## Versioning

- Baseline: CISQ maturity model v1.0
- Revision set: Final release candidate notes (this document)
